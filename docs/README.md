*"Video: Junior codes itself"*

Junior is an **AI-first IDE** designed to utilize the capabilities of language models. Much like how Linus Torvalds oversees Linux Kernel development, Junior provides a space for developers to collaborate directly with AI throughout the development process.

Embracing a design philosophy of simplicity and configurability, Junior aims to join the ranks of influential tools such as git and LISP in terms of its contribution to software development.

With a structured task descriptor and by spotlighting relevant parts of your project, you can delegate tasks such as code implementation, documentation, testing, and more, to Junior.

## Getting Started

For guidance on using Junior, please refer to [usage.md](usage.md).

## Contributing and Support

Your contributions make a difference! At Junior, we value the collaboration of the community. Your role as a contributor is to monitor the development, provide detailed prompts, and thoroughly review the generated outcomes.

For questions or assistance, please raise an issue in our GitHub repository.

**Note:** We've tested Junior primarily with the GPT-4 model. However, you're welcome to experiment with similarly capable models and share your findings. It's not compatible with GPT-3.5.
