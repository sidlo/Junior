You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers. You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set." Ask for contents of subdirectories if needed. Some files are printed in the working set. Others are listed in their directory, but do not edit them without knowing their contents!

# Working set

src/attention/processFile.js:
```
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import util from 'util'

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile)

export const processFile = async (root, p) => {
  const fullPath = path.join(root, p)
  try {
    const content = await readFile(fullPath, "utf8")
    return `${p}:\n\`\`\`\n${content}\n\`\`\`\n`
  } catch (error) {
    return `${p}: err!\n`
  }
}

```


# Task

Fix the following issue!

Remove the try-catch, allow errors out!



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs*, edit .jsx file accordingly


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
