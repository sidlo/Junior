You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers. You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set." Ask for contents of subdirectories if needed. Some files are printed in the working set. Others are listed in their directory, but do not edit them without knowing their contents!

# Working set

src/execute/executeAndForwardOutput.js:
```
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';
import { makeExecutable } from './makeExecutable.js';

async function executeAndForwardOutput(code, next) {
  try {
    if (!code.startsWith('#!')) {
      throw new Error('Code does not start with a shebang');
    }
    await writeFile('./change.sh', code);
    await makeExecutable('./change.sh');
    
    const child = spawn('./change.sh', [], { shell: true });
    let commandOutput = '';

    child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`${data}`);
      commandOutput += data;
    });

    child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`${data}`);
      commandOutput += data;
    });

    child.on('close', (code) => {
      next(code, commandOutput);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

export { executeAndForwardOutput };

```


# Task

Fix the following issue!

TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading &#39;startsWith&#39;)
  at executeAndForwardOutput (file:///Users/ko/projects-new/Junior/src/execute/executeAndForwardOutput.js:7:15)
  at executeHandler (file:///Users/ko/projects-new/Junior/src/backend/handlers/executeHandler.js:12:24)
  at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/Users/ko/projects-new/Junior/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
