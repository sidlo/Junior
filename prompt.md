You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers.
You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set."
Before starting, check if you need more files to solve the task.
Do not edit files without knowing their contents!
Ask for them in normal conversational format instead.

# Working set

src/frontend/App.jsx:
```
import useKeyBindings from './service/useKeyBindings';
import keyBindings from './config/keyBindings';
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import PromptCreation from './components/PromptCreation';
import ChangeExecution from './components/ChangeExecution';
import ChangeInspection from './components/ChangeInspection';
import ChangeFinalization from './components/ChangeFinalization';

const App = () => {
  // Define key bindings
  const bindings = keyBindings();

  // Use key bindings
  useKeyBindings(bindings);

  return (
    <div id="app" class="p-2 sm:p-4 xs:p-4">
      <div class="max-w-desktop lg:max-w-desktop md:max-w-full sm:max-w-full xs:max-w-full mx-auto flex flex-col items-center space-y-8 sm:p-0">
        <NavBar />
        <PromptCreation />
        <ChangeExecution />
        <ChangeInspection />
        <ChangeFinalization />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

```

src/frontend/index.html:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">

```


# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

Add bg-emphasize class to the &#34;app&#34; div in index.html
Add bg-main to the inner div in App.jsx.
Remove the id attribute from outer (id=&#34;app&#34;) in App.jsx, as the real app div is in the html.
Move the p-2 class from the outer to the inner div.
Remove unnecessary comments.



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs*, edit .jsx file accordingly


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
