You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers. You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set." Ask for contents of subdirectories if needed. Some files are printed in the working set. Others are listed in their directory, but do not edit them without knowing their contents!

# Working set

scripts/updateLogo.js:
```
import sharp from 'sharp';
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';

const inputSVGPath = 'docs/assets/logo.svg';
const outputPNGPath = 'docs/assets/logo.png';
const faviconDocsPath = 'docs/assets/favicon.ico';
const faviconFrontendPath = 'src/frontend/assets/favicon.ico';

const updateLogo = async () => {
  try {
    const buffer = await sharp(inputSVGPath).png().toBuffer();
    writeFileSync(outputPNGPath, buffer);

    // Convert logo to favicon sizes
    const faviconBuffer = await sharp(inputSVGPath).resize(16, 16).ico().toBuffer();
    
    // Update favicon in both the docs and frontend directories
    writeFileSync(faviconDocsPath, faviconBuffer);
    writeFileSync(faviconFrontendPath, faviconBuffer);
  } catch (err) {
    throw err;
  }
};

updateLogo();

```


# Task

Fix the following issue!

file:///Users/ko/projects-new/Junior/scripts/updateLogo.js:15
    const faviconBuffer = await sharp(inputSVGPath).resize(16, 16).ico().toBuffer();
                                                                  ^

TypeError: sharp(...).resize(...).ico is not a function
    at updateLogo (file:///Users/ko/projects-new/Junior/scripts/updateLogo.js:15:68)

Node.js v18.5.0



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs*, edit .jsx file accordingly


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
