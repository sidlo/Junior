You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers. You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set." Ask for contents of subdirectories if needed. Some files are printed in the working set. Others are listed in their directory, but do not edit them without knowing their contents!

# Working set

src/frontend/useKeyBindings.js:
```
const useKeyBindings = (bindings) => {
  const handler = (e) => {
    // Ignore bindings if target is input or textarea
    if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT' || e.target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {
      return;
    }
    const action = bindings[e.key.toUpperCase()];
    if (action) {
      action(e);
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handler);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', handler);
  };
};

export default useKeyBindings;

```

src/frontend/App.jsx:
```
import useKeyBindings from './useKeyBindings';
import keyBindings from './config/keyBindings';
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import PromptCreation from './components/PromptCreation';
import ChangeExecution from './components/ChangeExecution';
import ChangeInspection from './components/ChangeInspection';
import ChangeFinalization from './components/ChangeFinalization';

const App = () => {
  // Define key bindings
  const bindings = keyBindings();

  // Use key bindings
  useKeyBindings(bindings);

  return (
    <div id="app" class="p-2">
      <div class="max-w-desktop lg:max-w-desktop md:max-w-full sm:max-w-full xs:max-w-full mx-auto flex flex-col items-center space-y-8 sm:p-0">
        <NavBar />
        <PromptCreation />
        <ChangeExecution />
        <ChangeInspection />
        <ChangeFinalization />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

```


# Task

Move the following files to the specified target dirs!

Find out the best target dir if it is not specified!

You need to follow dependencies to maintain coherence.

Before executing, write a concise plan! The plan should show:
 - How do you avoid breaking other parts of the code.
 - If you had to choose, your way of thinking.

Move useKeyBindings to src/frontend/service/

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: Debian


Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
