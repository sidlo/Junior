You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers.
You are working with a part of a large program called the "Working Set."
Before starting, check if you need more files to solve the task.
Do not edit files without knowing their contents!
Ask for them in normal conversational format instead.

*"Video: Junior codes itself"*
## Description

Junior is an exploratory project aimed at revolutionizing the way programmers interact with the development process. Just like how Linus Torvalds oversees the Linux Kernel development without coding himself, this project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process.

Isn't that already possible with ChatGPT? No, LLMs have very limited "working memory", so it is not possible to directly work with them on large codebases.

By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Junior.

## Getting Started

For more details on getting started, please refer to [usage.md](usage.md).

## Contributing and Support

Contributions are welcome! Remember, we eat our own dog food in this project. Junior is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes.

For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.

**Note:** For meaningful results, it's recommended to use the GPT-4 model or a more recent version.

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

Update video link to https://youtu.be/NL4uFJSvfW0
Instead of the sentence &#34;Junior is an exploratory project...&#34; write about Junior being an AI-first IDE designed from the ground up to leverage language models.



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx file accordingly!


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```

EXAMPLE END
