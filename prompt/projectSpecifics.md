## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!
- Remove _all existing comments_ from the code!
- Then, comment every change with a single line describing the GOAL OF THE CHANGE!
